## About Dataset
* Source: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
* Objective: The dataset aims to perform research on patients with diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements. The focus is on females who are at least 21 years old and of Pima Indian heritage.
* Format: The dataset is available in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format.
* Variables: The dataset contains several independent variables (features) and one target variable for diabetes prediction.

This dataset is widely used for machine learning and statistical analysis to build predictive models for diabetes diagnosis. The team has planned to work on with this dataset to perform data quality and exploration related activities by loading the CSV file into your preferred data analysis environment Python with libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn.

# Technical Description 

# Data:  

Dataset Name: Diabetes Dataset 

Author: Pima Indians 

Source: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases 

Format: CSV (Comma-Separated Values) 

Objective: Research on diabetes patients based on specific diagnostic measurements. 

 

# Data Preprocessing: 

Removal of duplicates. 

Removal of empty inputs 

Conversion of data into required data types. 

 

# Tools: 

Implemented with MVC (Model View Controller) architecture. 

Server-side programming with Python. 

 
Model: 

Developed using Flask RESTful APIs. 

View: 

Developed with Flask render templates using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 

Controller: 

Developed using Flask Web Application routers. 

Deployment Platform: 

Heroku, a cloud-based PaaS platform supporting the build and deployment of web applications. 

Tools Used: 

Front End: Flask/HTML/CSS 

Back End: Python/scikit-learn 

Database: Not applicable 

Tools: Visual Studio Code, Python (flask, scikit-learn, pickle, pandas, numpy, fast_eda) 

User Functionalities: 

The application supports the following functionalities for managing crime incidents and charges data: 

View statistical reports: 

Descriptive Statistics to depict the correlation between input parameters and classified result. How the input parameters influence the probability of diabetes.  

Bivariate Correlations 

Histogram and Boxplot 

Diabetes Predictions. 

Slides the input parameters to see the probability of having diabetes or not.

# Functionalities
The application will perform data science functions like stats and visualization etc. It will provide statistical summaries, and analysis of datasets, including descriptive statistics. Also, create data visualization such as charts, graphs and heatmap etc. 
We had gone through both the provided references on website development and connected as a team to review these available options for website development like shiny and Flask. We are comfortable to use both Flask and Shiny however still exploring more to narrow down to final option.
