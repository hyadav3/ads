# Web Application for Diabetes Dataset Visualization

# Project Summary

The Web-Based Diabetes Dataset Visualization Application is a data visualization tool designed to provide insights into the Python Diabetes dataset. 
This project aims to create a user-friendly web application that allows users to explore, analyze, and gain meaningful insights from the dataset. 
The Python Diabetes dataset contains medical data related to diabetes patients, making it valuable for researchers, healthcare professionals, and data enthusiasts.

# Project Objectives 

The primary goal of this project is to create a web application that empowers users, including researchers, healthcare professionals, and data enthusiasts, 
to explore the Python Diabetes dataset with ease.

About Dataset
Source: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
Objective: The dataset aims to perform research on patients with diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements. The focus is on females who are at least 21 years old and of Pima Indian heritage.
Format: The dataset is available in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format.
Variables: The dataset contains several independent variables (features) and one target variable for diabetes prediction.
This dataset is widely used for machine learning and statistical analysis to build predictive models for diabetes diagnosis. The team has planned to work on with this dataset to perform data quality and exploration related activities by loading the CSV file into your preferred data analysis environment Python with libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn.

# Functionalities
The application will perform data science functions like stats and visualization etc. It will provide statistical summaries, and analysis of datasets, including descriptive statistics. Also, create data visualization such as charts, graphs and heatmap etc. 
We had gone through both the provided references on website development and connected as a team to review these available options for website development like shiny and Flask. We are comfortable to use both Flask and Shiny however still exploring more to narrow down to final option.
